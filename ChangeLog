            MarkedBlock::allocateBlock will have the wrong allocation size when (sizeof(MarkedBlock) + bytes) is divisible by WTF::pageSize()
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148500

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            Consider the following scenario:
            - On OS X, WTF::pageSize() is 4*1024 bytes.
            - JSEnvironmentRecord::allocationSizeForScopeSize(6621) == 53000
            - sizeof(MarkedBlock) == 248
            - (248 + 53000) is a multiple of 4*1024.
            - (248 + 53000)/(4*1024) == 13

            We will allocate a chunk of memory of size 53248 bytes that looks like this:
            0            248       256                       53248       53256
            [Marked Block | 8 bytes |  payload     ......      ]  8 bytes  |
                                    ^                                      ^
                               Our Environment record starts here.         ^
                                                                           ^
                                                                     Our last JSValue in the environment record will go from byte 53248 to 53256. But, we don't own this memory.

            We need to ensure that we round up sizeof(MarkedBlock) to an
            atomSize boundary. We need to do this because the first atom
            inside the MarkedBlock will start at the rounded up multiple
            of atomSize past MarkedBlock. If we end up with an allocation
            that is perfectly aligned to the page size, then we will be short
            8 bytes (in the current implementation where atomSize is 16 bytes,
            and MarkedBlock is 248 bytes).

            DFG::ArgumentsEliminationPhase should emit a PutStack for all of the GetStacks that the ByteCodeParser emitted
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147433
            rdar://problem/21668986

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            Ideally, the ByteCodeParser would only emit SetArgument nodes for named arguments.  But
            currently that's not what it does - it emits a SetArgument for every argument that a varargs
            call may pass.  Each SetArgument gets turned into a GetStack.  This means that if
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase optimizes away PutStacks for those varargs arguments that didn't
            get passed or used, we get degenerate IR where we have a GetStack of something that didn't
            have a PutStack.

            This fixes the bug by removing the code to optimize away PutStacks in
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase.

            Fixed VM pool allocation should have a reserve for allocations that cannot fail
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147154

            Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

            This adds the notion of a JIT pool reserve fraction. Some fraction, currently 1/4, of
            the JIT pool is reserved for allocations that cannot fail. It makes sense to make this
            a fraction rather than a constant because each allocation that can fail may cause some
            number of allocations that cannot fail (for example, the OSR exit thunks that we
            compile when we exit from some CodeBlock cannot fail).

            I've tested this by adding a test mode where we artificially limit the JIT pool size.
            Prior to the fix, we had >20 failures. Now we have none.
